# Assignment 6: Data Pipelines with Concurrency

## Background
This respository started off as a cloned repository from a project by [Amrit Singh](https://www.codeheim.io/) to demonstrate Go image processing pipeline with concurrency. The initial repository can be found [here](https://github.com/code-heim/go_21_goroutines_pipeline). He also put together a video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rn8yOQH62k).

## Roles of Programs and Data

## Application
An executable for this project was created using Windows. To create your own executable, run **go build** in the same directory as the go program. For more information, see the Gopher documentation on creating an executable [here](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/compile-install).
